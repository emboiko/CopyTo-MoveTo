Refactored w/ some OOP!
<br><br>
CopyTo-MoveTo is still very much in beta and various UI tweaks / improvements are still to come. Plans currently include a context menu in Explorer for this application. Additionally, the file dialog or "Add-Items" will also be refactored to be resuable (and expanded upon, most likely with search + filter features), as it was the entire point of writing this program. Calls to internal commands will most likely be tweaked and improved over time.

If you like or use CopyTo-MoveTo, please considering contributing to the source code, or request a new feature.
