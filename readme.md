# CopyTo-MoveTo

**Basic Installation and Usage:**
`python CopyTo-MoveTo.py`
**-or-**
Run `CopyTo-MoveTo.exe` from within its source directory using a shortcut.

Edit + execute `regkeys.reg` with a proper path/to/CopyTo-MoveTo.exe and add it to a context menu! Multiselect an arbitrary number of files and/or directories in Windows Explorer, and gather them in CopyTo-MoveTo

**Now featuring IPC:** CopyTo-MoveTo should only allow one copy of itself to exist at a time. Additional instances will pass their first (and only their first*) positional argument to the main process, where they will flow into the GUI's "source" box.
