Tips & Tricks:
--------------

- One instance of the application is allowed to run at a time.

- Run as administrator to avoid permission errors in most situations. Permission errors thrown from a move operation may still result in a copy.

- To enable a context menu entry or entries in Windows Explorer, edit regkeys.reg with a proper path to the application. This makes using CopyTo-MoveTo alongside windows explorer much more streamlined.

- Drill through the treeview with Doubleclick, Enter, or ArrowKeys. Directories are lazy loaded, and only read once.

- Navigate the listbox on the right with the mouse or arrow keys. Multiselect is supported with the Shift, Ctrl, or by dragging the mouse. Select all with <Ctrl+A> as expected. Confirm selection in the filedialog with Enter. 

- Drag + drop files/directories to CopyTo-MoveTo.exe's shortcut to run the application with those paths as arguments. Currently hardcoded to populate to origin listbox.

- The listboxes in the main window can be populated multiple times, and are only cleared upon a Copy/Move operation, or if the user deliberately clears them using the menu operations.
