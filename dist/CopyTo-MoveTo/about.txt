CopyTo-MoveTo is a GUI utility for making the process of copying and moving files and/or directories more explicit, and is intended to be used alongside Windows Explorer or by itself. It is built with Python + Tkinter/TCL, made for Windows platforms, and is dependency free. Support for Linux and Mac may come in the future. 

This program was [primarily] created to work around the limitations of built-in filedialogs included in dotNET, Tcl, and other GUI libraries. Standard dialogs do not support multi-selection of both files and directories all from a single dialog. This application implements a minimalist "Unified File Dialog" which doesn't impose such rules.

This application requires the user to make a deliberate choice between a Copy or Move and allows for slightly more complex operations without being forced to use the command line.

By default, duplicate items are renamed with an index(1). Enabling Ask Overwrite will prompt the user for further action if any paths crash into each other. (Rename Duplicates & Ask Overwrite are mutually exlusive settings) Skipped items are collected into separate lists: user-skipped, and those skipped due to errors (most likely a permission error or a change in the filesystem). For a smoother experience, run this program with elevated privileges when possible.
